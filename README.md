Shopping Cart Technical Test for BJSS

Project is coded as an Eclipse Java project (Java 1.8). Just import it to Eclipse as a Java project and run it as a Java application.

The main class is at:
src.com.bjss.cart.main.PriceBasket

Test cases can be run as Run unit test case:

The unit tests (Junit 3) are in the folder:
src.com.bjss.cart.test

I would envisage that more test cases could be added to test for the cross-item "half-price" rule.
